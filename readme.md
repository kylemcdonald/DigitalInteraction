# Digital Interaction
### [Kyle McDonald](kylemcdonald.net) and [Daito Manabe](http://daito.ws/) for [FITC 2013](http://fitc.ca/presentation/digital-interaction/)

## Description

Fingers have always been an important part of computation: from the moment we first started counting on our fingers (each digit representing an integer, the origin of the word ”digital”), up to the present with finger-driven devices like keyboards, mice, and motion sensors being our primary means of interface with machines. In this workshop we’ll cover advanced techniques for sensing hands and fingers, as well as electric stimulation techniques for controlling fingers.

Participants should have some experience programming, and come with Processing and Max installed. Other materials and source code will be distributed during the workshop.

## Code

### HandOSC

Demonstrates contour detection and OSC output with openFrameworks.

### HandOSCSine

Receives data from openFrameworks app and uses it to control sound in real time with Processing.

### HandTracker

Experimental work toward a precise model-based hand tracker with finger-level accuracy.
